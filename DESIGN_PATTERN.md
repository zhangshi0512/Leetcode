# Visualization of Design Patterns

Certainly! I'll group and number the diagrams under their respective categories.

### Creational Patterns

1. **Abstract Factory**

```mermaid
classDiagram
    AbstractFactory <|-- ConcreteFactory1
    AbstractFactory <|-- ConcreteFactory2
    AbstractFactory : +createProductA()
    AbstractFactory : +createProductB()
    ProductA <.. ConcreteFactory1
    ProductB <.. ConcreteFactory1
```

2. **Builder**

```mermaid
classDiagram
    Director -- Builder : constructs
    Builder <|-- ConcreteBuilder
    Builder : +buildPart()
    ConcreteBuilder : +buildPart()
    ConcreteBuilder : +getResult()
```

3. **Factory Method**

```mermaid
classDiagram
    Creator <|-- ConcreteCreator
    Creator : +factoryMethod()
    Product <.. Creator : creates
    ConcreteProduct <.. ConcreteCreator : creates
```

4. **Prototype**

```mermaid
classDiagram
    Prototype <|.. ConcretePrototype
    Prototype : +clone()
    Client -- Prototype : uses
```

5. **Singleton**

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Singleton {
        -static instance : Singleton
        -Singleton()
        +static getInstance() : Singleton
    }
```

### Structural Patterns

6. **Adapter**

```mermaid
classDiagram
    Target <|-- Adapter
    Adapter o-- Adaptee
    Client -- Target
```

7. **Bridge**

```mermaid
classDiagram
    Abstraction <|-- RefinedAbstraction
    Abstraction o-- Implementor
    Implementor <|-- ConcreteImplementor
```

8. **Composite**

```mermaid
classDiagram
    Component <|-- Leaf
    Component <|-- Composite
    Composite o-- Component
```

9. **Decorator**

```mermaid
classDiagram
    Component <|-- ConcreteComponent
    Component <|-- Decorator
    Decorator o-- Component
    Decorator <|-- ConcreteDecorator
```

10. **FaÃ§ade**

```mermaid
classDiagram
    Client -- Facade
    Facade o-- Subsystem1
    Facade o-- Subsystem2
```

11. **Flyweight**

```mermaid
classDiagram
    FlyweightFactory -- Flyweight : gets
    Flyweight <|.. ConcreteFlyweight
    Client -- FlyweightFactory : uses
```

12. **Proxy**

```mermaid
classDiagram
    Subject <|-- RealSubject
    Subject <|-- Proxy
    Client -- Proxy
    Proxy o-- RealSubject
```

### Behavior Patterns

13. **Chain-of-responsibility**

```mermaid
classDiagram
    Handler <|-- ConcreteHandler1
    Handler <|-- ConcreteHandler2
    Handler : +setSuccessor(Handler)
    Handler : +handleRequest()
    Client -- Handler
```

14. **Command**

```mermaid
classDiagram
    Command <|.. ConcreteCommand
    Client -- Command
    Command o-- Receiver : requests
    Invoker -- Command : invokes
```

15. **Interpreter**

```mermaid
classDiagram
    AbstractExpression <|.. TerminalExpression
    AbstractExpression <|.. NonterminalExpression
    AbstractExpression : +interpret(Context)
    Client -- AbstractExpression : uses
```

16. **Iterator**

```mermaid
classDiagram
    Aggregate <|-- ConcreteAggregate
    Iterator <|.. ConcreteIterator
    Aggregate : +createIterator()
    ConcreteIterator -- ConcreteAggregate
```

17. **Mediator**

```mermaid
classDiagram
    Mediator <|-- ConcreteMediator
    Colleague <|-- ConcreteColleague1
    Colleague <|-- ConcreteColleague2
    Colleague o-- Mediator : communicates
```

18. **Memento**

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Originator {
        +createMemento() : Memento
        +setMemento(Memento)
    }

    class Memento {
        -state
        +getState() : State
        +setState(State)
    }

    class Caretaker {
        -memento : Memento
    }

    Originator --> Memento : creates
    Caretaker --> Memento : holds

```

19. **Observer**

```mermaid
classDiagram
    Subject <|-- ConcreteSubject
    Observer <|.. ConcreteObserver
    Subject : +attach(Observer)
    Subject : +detach(Observer)
    Subject : +notify()
    ConcreteSubject : +getState()
    ConcreteSubject : +setState()
    ConcreteObserver o-- ConcreteSubject
```

20. **State**

```mermaid
classDiagram
    Context o-- State
    State <|.. ConcreteStateA
    State <|.. ConcreteStateB
    Context : +request()
```

21. **Strategy**

```mermaid
classDiagram
    Context o-- Strategy : uses
    Strategy <|.. ConcreteStrategyA
    Strategy <|.. ConcreteStrategyB
```

22. **Template Method**

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class AbstractClass {
        +templateMethod()
        +primitiveOperation1()
        +primitiveOperation2()
    }

    class ConcreteClass {
        +primitiveOperation1()
        +primitiveOperation2()
    }

    AbstractClass <|-- ConcreteClass
```

23. **Visitor**

```mermaid
classDiagram
    Element <|-- ConcreteElementA
    Element <|-- ConcreteElementB
    Visitor <|.. ConcreteVisitor1
    Visitor <|.. ConcreteVisitor2
    Element : +accept(Visitor)
    ConcreteVisitor1 : +visitConcreteElementA(ConcreteElementA)
    ConcreteVisitor1 : +visitConcreteElementB(ConcreteElementB)
```

With these diagrams, you should have a clear visual representation of the relationships and roles in each pattern. Remember, these are general outlines; specifics might differ based on the particular use case and requirements.
