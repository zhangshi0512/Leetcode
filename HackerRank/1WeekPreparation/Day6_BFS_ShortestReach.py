"""
Consider a n undirected graph where each
edge weighs 6 units. Each of the nodes is
labeled consecutively fro m 1 to n.

You will be given a number Of queries. For
each query, yo u will be given a list 0f
edges describing a n undirected graph.
After you create a representation Of the
graph, you must determine and report
the shortest distance tO each Of the other
nodes from a given starting position using
the breadth-first search algorithm (BFS).
Return a n array Of distances from the
start node in node number order. If a
node is unreachable, return - 1 for that
node.

Function Description
Complete the bfs function in the editor
below. If a node is unreachable, i ts
distance is - 1.
bfs has the following parameter(s):
路 int n: the number Of nodes
路 int m: the number Of edges
路 int edges[m][2] start and end nodes for edges
路 int s: the node tO sta rt traversals from
Returns
int[n-1]: the distances tO nodes in
increasing node number order, not
including the start node (-1 if a node is not
reachable)

Input Format
The fi rst line contains a n integer q, the
number Of queries. Each Of the following
q sets 0f lines has the following format:

- The first line contains two space-
separated integers and m, the
number Of nodes and edges in the
graph.
- Each line Of the m subsequent lines
contains tWO space-separated integers,
u and v that describe a n edge between
nodes u and v.
- The last line contains a single integer, S,
the node number to start from.

Sample Input:
4 2
1 2
1 3
3 1
2 3

Sample Output
6 6 -1
-1 6
