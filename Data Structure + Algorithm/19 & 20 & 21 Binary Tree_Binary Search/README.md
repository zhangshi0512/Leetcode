# Big O Analysis

Here's a table showing the Big O complexity for some common operations in a binary tree:

| Operation             | Average Case Time Complexity | Worst Case Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Search                | O(log n)                     | O(n)                       | O(n)             |
| Insert                | O(log n)                     | O(n)                       | O(n)             |
| Delete                | O(log n)                     | O(n)                       | O(n)             |
| Access                | O(log n)                     | O(n)                       | O(n)             |
| Find Min/Max          | O(log n)                     | O(n)                       | O(n)             |
| Successor/Predecessor | O(log n)                     | O(n)                       | O(n)             |
| In-order Traversal    | O(n)                         | O(n)                       | O(n)             |

This table assumes that the binary tree is a balanced binary search tree. In the worst-case scenario, the binary tree can become a linked list (if every node has only one child), hence the O(n) time complexity.

# Code Template

Now, let's create a Python class that implements a binary tree:

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, key):
        self.left = None
        self.right = None
        self.val = key


class BinaryTree:
    def __init__(self):
        self.root = None

    def insert(self, key):
        if self.root is None:
            self.root = Node(key)
        else:
            self._insert(self.root, key)

    def _insert(self, node, key):
        if node.val < key:
            if node.right is None:
                node.right = Node(key)
            else:
                self._insert(node.right, key)
        else:
            if node.left is None:
                node.left = Node(key)
            else:
                self._insert(node.left, key)

    def inorder(self):
        self._inorder(self.root)
        print()

    def _inorder(self, node):
        if node is not None:
            self._inorder(node.left)
            print(node.val, end=' ')
            self._inorder(node.right)

    # Add methods for search, delete, min, max, successor, predecessor etc. here


# Sample usage:
bt = BinaryTree()
bt.insert(5)
bt.insert(3)
bt.insert(7)
bt.inorder()  # Output: 3 5 7
```

Please note that this is a basic template and doesn't include all operations like deletion, search, finding min and max, and finding successor and predecessor. Also, this implementation doesn't ensure that the tree remains balanced. To maintain a balanced tree, you would want to look into specific types of binary trees, such as AVL trees or red-black trees.
