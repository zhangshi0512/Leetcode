# Big O Analysis

Sure, I can provide the typical time and space complexity for common operations on a stack data structure in Python. Note that Python doesn't have a built-in "Stack" data structure, but lists are typically used to simulate stacks due to their O(1) time complexity for add (push) and remove (pop) operations at the end of the list.

| Operation | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
| --------- | --------------- | ---------------- |
| Push      | O(1)            | O(1)             |
| Pop       | O(1)            | O(1)             |
| Top/Peek  | O(1)            | O(1)             |
| Search    | O(n)            | O(1)             |
| IsEmpty   | O(1)            | O(1)             |
| Size      | O(1)            | O(1)             |

# Code Template

As for the stack implementation in Python, here's a basic template:

```python
class Stack:
    def __init__(self):
        self.stack = []

    # Add an element to top of stack
    def push(self, data):
        return self.stack.append(data)

    # Remove and return the element from top of stack
    def pop(self):
        if not self.is_empty():
            return self.stack.pop()
        return "Stack is empty."

    # Check if stack is empty
    def is_empty(self):
        return len(self.stack) == 0

    # Return (but do not remove) the element at top of stack
    def peek(self):
        if not self.is_empty():
            return self.stack[-1]
        return "Stack is empty."

    # Get size of stack
    def size(self):
        return len(self.stack)

    # Search for an element in the stack
    def search(self, data):
        if data in self.stack:
            return True
        return False
```

In this implementation, the stack is stored in a list (`self.stack`), and all methods are O(1) for time complexity except for the `search` method, which is O(n) because in the worst case we have to check every item in the stack. The space complexity for each operation is also O(1), because each operation only requires a constant amount of space to perform.
